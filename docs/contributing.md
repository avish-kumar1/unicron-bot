## Pull Request Process

If you'd like to contribute to Unicron, start by forking the repository on GitHub:

The best way to get your changes merged back into core is as follows:

* If you are about to add a larger feature, open an issue on the GitHub issue tracker to discuss your ideas first. If whatever you're about to implement is already in the issue tracker, please let us know that you picked it up.
* Clone down your fork.
* Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change.
* Write some code.
* Add tests and make sure everything still passes by running bundle exec rake. This is mandatory for pull requests to be accepted.
* If you are adding new functionality, document it!
* Do not change the version number.
* If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors.
* Push the branch up to GitHub.
* Send a pull request to the oadpoaw/unicron-bot project.

## Project Governance

**This is an** [**OPEN Open Source Project**](http://openopensource.org/)**.**

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
2. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
3. **External API changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
4. Internal pull requests to solicit feedback are _encouraged_ for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
5. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code style.

### Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.
